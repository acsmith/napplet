# Default build properties for napplet library.  Based on the
# Processing Library Template by Andreas Schlegel.

# It's unlikely that these will work as-is on your machine; to
# override any of these assignments, create a build.properties
# file in the same directory and enter your own settings.
# (You can copy the entire contents of this file into the 
# build.properties file and then edit it there, if you like.)



# Processing sketchbook location.  Default for unix-y systems.

sketchbook.location=${user.home}/sketchbook

# On Windows, this is probably to be something like:
# sketchbook.location=${user.home}/My Documents/Processing 



# Path to jar files required for compiling (i.e., Processing's
# lib file.)

classpath.local.location=$../processing-1.1/lib

# For OSX users, apparently the following line is appropriate.
# classpath.local.location=/Applications/Processing.app/Contents/Resources/Java/

# This is where I keep Processing on my Windows machines:
# classpath.local.location=${user.home}/My Stuff/Processing/lib



# Required jar files from the above library path. This

classpath.local.include=core.jar

# Add processing's libraries folder to the classpath (i.e., the
# place where you put user-installed libraries.)

classpath.libraries.location=${sketchbook.location}/libraries
